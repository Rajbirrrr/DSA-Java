/*When we take -2, the current sum becomes negative, so it is reset to zero.
The maximum sum is the maximum of current sum and the old maximum → max(0, -∞) = 0.

When we take -3, again the current sum is negative and reset to zero.
The maximum sum is → max(0, 0) = 0.

When we take 4, the current sum becomes four.
The maximum sum is → max(4, 0) = 4, so it gets updated. ✅

When we take -1, the current sum drops to three.
The maximum sum is → max(3, 4) = 4, so it stays the same.

When we take -2, the current sum reduces to one.
The maximum sum is → max(1, 4) = 4, so no change.

When we take 1, the current sum rises slightly to two.
The maximum sum is → max(2, 4) = 4, still unchanged.

When we take 5, the current sum jumps to seven.
The maximum sum is → max(7, 4) = 7, so it gets updated. ✅

When we take -3, the current sum drops back to four.
The maximum sum is → max(4, 7) = 7, so it stays the same.*/
